# Project-Euler Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems designed to encourage algorithmic thinking and efficient problem-solving.

Rather than focusing only on obtaining correct answers, this repository emphasizes clarity of reasoning, mathematical insight, and computational efficiency.

## Languages Used
- Python

## What I’m Learning
Through these problems, I am developing:
- Algorithmic problem-solving skills
- Mathematical reasoning (number theory, combinatorics, sequences)
- Writing efficient and readable code
- Translating abstract problems into computational solutions
